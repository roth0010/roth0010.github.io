                This blog is a summary of my previous experience with programming. A lot of the text comes straight from
                an
                assignment done before the school year even started, called a "study check." Basically this was to check
                and see that the program would be a good fit for me and that I wasn't going to flounder and fall behind.
                These are the things I said way back in March of 2021 - wow, that was a while ago!
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Question 1: Do you have any programming experience? I answered yes to this, as I had done some
                programming before at school as early as middle school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 2: You stated you had some programming experience. Can you tell us where you had this
                experience? Technically it was from prior education, but I didn't feel educated in coding. I marked it
                anyway since it was the best option all things considered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 3: Motivate your programming experience. What kind of experience did you had? Which language(s)
                or platform(s)? Etc. It wasn't any proper coding language like C++ or Python - In middle school, we did
                some light coding with a website called Scratch that had drag and drop coding. There wasn't really
                anything notable created there, considering it was middle school. In high school engineering class, we
                used a programming language similar to C++ (I think) to program some robots to do various things - have
                a car drive forward, make a timing system, etc. So far my high school computer science class hasn't used
                any advanced programming, but that may change with the second trimester of the class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Question 4: Chances are that this questionnaire raises questions and/or doubts about your study choice.
                If so, we recommend to plan a personal study choice interview with one of the teachers. Do you want to
                plan such an interview? I didn't see the need, so I didn't. A few months later, I was flying over the
                arctic to get to my new school on the other side of the world.
