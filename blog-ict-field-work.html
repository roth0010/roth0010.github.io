    <h4>14 September 2021</h4>
    <article class="journey-art">
        <div class="journey-text">
            <p>
                They were calling this event a "company safari," but for some reason that didn't sit very well with me.
                Instead, I made my own title for it in all it's boringness. This blog talks about three ICT companies -
                some of which were done as a *suprise* group project - and what they do and where they are located.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Company 1: Accenture
            </h4>
            <p>
                Congratulations to the team at Accenture for creating the most uninspiring and boring logo and company
                name - even their website shares the same stiff upper lip and unoffensiveness, with all the creativity
                of a fax machine. Business jargon on their website makes up a significant portion of the text, which I
                guess is to be expected because they're a consulting company. Seriously, how boring can you get? While
                they do boast lots of offices in the Netherlands and seem to be intersted in future programmers - they
                even have some internships displayed prominently on their boring website - they also have a lot of dead
                links on the pages that would otherwise tell you more about their opportunities. Safe to say this one is
                a company of last resort.
            </p>
            <h4>Company 2: DXC Technology</h4>
            <p>
                DXC Technology are an American technology corporation based in Tysons, Virginia. They specialize in
                business to business situations, which I believe means transactions between companies, and in various
                cloud based services. I know this
                company prior to this project from their sponsoring of an Indycar on a few occasions - proof that
                advertising in motorsport is effective marketing! Although I initially thought they were limited to
                offices in just America, it seems they have a much larger span than just the states. DXC has offices
                around the world, with over 100,000 employees. They offer a 12 month program with the company, which
                sounds a lot like an internship. With that said, I struggle to find evidence of a DXC location within
                the Netherlands.
            </p>
            <h4>Company 3: NTT Data</h4>
            <p>
                NTT Data is a partially owned subsidiary of NTT (Nippon Telephone & Telegraph), a Japanese
                telecommunications company that has grown beyond simply providing phone service. NTT Data, much like the
                others mentioned, provides IT services to companies and also does consulting. They appear to be
                partnered with SAP, a security company. They have one location in the Netherlands - in 's-Hertogenbosch
                - but interestingly don't list any locations in Japan, where NTT is from. Their website fails to mention
                anything about internships, which is unfortunate because this is a company I would be interested in.
