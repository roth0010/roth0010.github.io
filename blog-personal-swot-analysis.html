                This blog is a summary of my strengths and weaknesses, coming straight from the study check I did a few
                months ago. It follows the SWOT format - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats - to analyse
                one's self.
                That was way back in March of 2021 - wow, that was a while ago!

                Strengths: What do you do best? What are your positive traits? I definitely feel that I pay attention to minor details, and work hard when I'm interested and engaged in a project
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Weaknesses: What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies / career? I definitely feel that some forgetfulness and ADHD can mean certain projects go unfinished longer than they should.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Opportunities: How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities? I feel like, if I can create a system for reminding myself and keeping tasks in order, I can definitely compensate for my forgetfulness.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Threats:  What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career? Living on my own in a foreign country will definitely have its obstacles - having to cook for myself, commute, basically being an adult.
