            <h4>Making changes</h4>
            <p>
                The first version of the website is dead, long live version 1.1! Changes have been made here to actually
                use the feedback given and overall improve the website. The most prominent change is one of colour
                scheme: The E6 colorscheme has unfortunately gone, instead the colorscheme of the equally modern E7
                Shinkansen has painted the website. The logo for the website now stays inline with the navigation
                buttons at all times, and the bottons are rounded. I've added an underline of sorts to the bottom of the
                navbar, attempting to mirror the design of the E7 in some regards. The footer's have also changed - for
                the record graders, that was a solid 2.5 seconds to change, literally change the colour code and reload
                the page after saving. Done, mark that one off your checklist. The Homepage is undergoing a massive
                rework, as you are now greated with a massive picture of an E7 Shinkansen, and a lot less text on that
                page - less is more. Lots of pages got pictures that span the whole page, accenting the titles, and
                those that didn't got new backgrounds as a sort of an experiment. The blogs were padded out with new
                entries, the motivation moved to the blogs, and the entire thing was generally given a makeover. That's
                been the latest with the upgrades here on the website.</p>
