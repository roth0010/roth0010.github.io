            <h4>The First Pitch</h4>
            <p>
                It came time to test myself against the standards for this project - presenting the website I had
                constructed over the two prior weeks as I made it up as I went. Some aspects went well - I consider
                myself to be a gifted speaker in some aspects - while others were in need of improvement, website
                included. The website, with it's old blocky Navbar in crimson red and white color scheme, with its grey
                accents. While I mocked a consultancy company for their boring, unoffensive website, it was I who was
                the hypocrite, as this edition of the webste lacked style in much the same way. The philosiphy behind
                the homepage needed work - less is more, and I had put a wall of text or two in that page to make up for
                something? It needed to be redone. The internals of the website also needed a clean - some inline
                styling was hastily put in when HTML refused to cooperate, a temporary bandage that needed fixing before
                the next showcasing. Others watched as I failed to give insights into the website, probably under the
                pressure, forgetting some of the intricate details baked into the site that I brought from the depths of
                my interests. There was much room for imporevement, in style, construction, and presentation, but at
                least all the pages were there and it didn't look tacky.
