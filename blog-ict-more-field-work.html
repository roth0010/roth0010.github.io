            <h4>Company Safari but with actually interesting companies this time.</h4>
            <p>
                I kind of messed up the last Company Safari thing - appearently we were supposed to write about
                companies we found interesting AND that we would be interested working/interning for. I got the first
                half correct in most regards, but the second was a little lacking. Here's an attempt to make that right.
            </p>
            <h4>Company 1: Google</h4>
            <p>Google has a lot of locations around the world - you can almost pick any country and find a Google office
                there. Amsterdam is the only location in the Netherlands with a Google office, and Japan only has two -
                both in Tokyo. If you can ignore the moral implications of helping a giant monopoly make inroads on
                collecting all the data in the world about people whether they want to be probed or not, Google is a
                good company to work for. Granted, it's largest locations are in California and the US in general, which
                always leaves the opportunity for getting dragged kicking and screaming back to America. Ugh. Google
                does more than just seach results - Google Docs, Phones, IT services through their cloud services (The
                word cloud has lost its meaning on me at this point), and more. There's no shortage of opportunities
                with Google.</p>
            <h4>Company 2: Ellips Produce Grading</h4>
            <p>Ellips is an interesting company to say the least. Operating out of a small office by IT standards in
                Eindhoven, they create software that checks fruit and produce in general for imperfections, grading them
                and determining which fruit have superficial imperfections, which fruit appear fine outside but have
                rotten insides, and other fruit logistics. They seem to be using a lot of Machine Learning to make their
                programs better, which means the coders don't actually understand what's going on inside the black box
                of their code. The company boasts a small team - probably under 50 people - and claims to have a good
                environment for coding. For once, I may actually believe that claim. Although the work seems daunting as
                I don't fully understand the innerworkings of Machine Learning, and the fact that they seem to be more
                interested in WO interns than HBOs, this one is a moderately good fit.</p>
            <h4>Company 3: ICT Group</h4>
            <p>ICT Group is a massive group doing ICT. You probably got that from the name of their company, but it's an
                apt description. Based in Rotterdam, they seem to have their fingers in all sorts of pies - Healthcare,
                manufacturing, logistics, oil & gas, and the one that caught my eye the most: rail. ICT Group seems to
                be somehow involved with Nederlandse Spoorwegen in the design and maintenance of their signalling
                systems, which may involve ERTMS and ETCS in some capacity since that's the new standard. As a train
                geek, this makes the company infinitely more interesting than the others since it seems to be right up
                my alley. Rotterdam is a great city too, with an awesome station that I was recently able to visit. They
                have internships available, however they seem to go fast as they're already filled for the upcoming
                semester. All in all, a boring name for an interesting company!</p>
            <h4>Company 4: CM.com</h4>
            <p>Here's another company with a racing connection: CM.com sponsors the Zandvoort Circuit, home to the Dutch
                Grand Prix from 2021 onwards. To the best of my understanding, CM makes costumer service tools and
                programs, with things like automated chat bots, payment systems, and those annoying automated voice
                robots that answer your calls just to annoy you, it seems. Despite not being the most interesting
                company in the world, they do seem to be a more modern company with a desire to have a decent working
                environment. Their main offices are in Breda, with smaller offices in Arnhem and Utrecht, and a few
                international offices too - but none in Japan, interstingly. A pretty straight forward company.</p>
            <h4>Company 5: Heusinkveld</h4>
            <p>If you thought some of the other companies were out of left field, this one is crazy. Niels Heusinkveld
                is a... well, I'm not sure what to call him. He's a Dutchman living in Groningen, that's for sure, but
                his creations that he's made in racing simulators like Automobilista make you think he's a physics god
                or something.When he's just messing around, he makes creations like a driveable shed, a giant 390 ton
                tonka truck, and some other wacky creations that make you question whether he should be left alone with
                a computer. Although at one point he was instrumental in the success of the Automobilista simulator,
                coding the exceptional physics of that particular program, he has since moved into the physical realm,
                making sim racing pedals. Really, really nice sim racing pedals. His company is growing at an alarming
                rate thanks to Youtube exposure and the general popularity of the sim racing market as a whole, and as
                such I could see him expanding his venture in the future. Granted, his company is very, very small so
                jobs would be more of a lottery than with a larger company, but at the same time soneone needs to code
                the firmware of the pedals.</p>
            <h4>Company 6: Reiza Studios</h4>
            <p>Another left field company, not even based in Europe or North America. Reiza studios are the makers of
                the aformentioned Automobilista game and its successor, Automobilista 2. Naturally, coders are required
                to make this game work, as they are required to make their website, which currently says its under
                construction and provides no information on careers at their company. My understanding is, like
                Heusinkveld, the company is tiny, and as such there's likely few opportunities to work for the company.
                Nonetheless, sim racing is one of my hobbies, and to be able to work on my simulator of choice would be
                awesome - and, as Niels Heusinkveld indirectly proved through his time working for them, there's no need
                to move to Brazil, where the company is based, so theoretically you could work from literally anywhere
                with an internet connection.</p>
