                This blog is a summary of why I chose the program I did. A lot of the text comes straight from an
                assignment done before the school year even started, called a "study check." Basically this was to check
                and see that the program would be a good fit for me and that I wasn't going to flounder and fall behind.
                These are the things I said way back in March of 2021 - wow, that was a while ago!

                I'm currently taking an "exploring computer science" course, and so far it's been smooth sailing. I
                definitely feel this is an area I could pursue more.

                For most of my life, I've been fascinated by the world of trains. This slowly expanded to
                transportation, and further into the design and engineering of transportation systems in the world. This
                has enlightened me to a lot of the failures of the American style of designing a transportation system -
                that is, building freeways through populated downtowns. I started to do research into how other
                countries built their systems, and found that I liked the european system, which in general focused more
                on trains and less on cars. This desire to leave was only reinforced when I started driving, and only
                found it a stressful and expensive experience. The Netherlands immediately stood out as a front runner
                in my rankings of european countries, mostly owing to the extensive network of bike paths, and so I set
                my sights for there. I was assuming that it would take me decades to even have a chance at living in the
                Netherlands long term, but one December evening while browsing Reddit of all places, this changed. I
                found out that Dutch colleges allow international students to apply and come on a student visa, a
                literal dream come true. I immediately began searching for schools that I could apply for, avoiding the
                more costly higher tier universities that I have unfortunately forgotten the name of, and narrowed again
                by colleges in a high-demand urban area. This left only a handful of schools, of which HZ was a front
                runner. HZ also had a nice location on the coast, and wasn't crazy expensive or in high demand, with few
                competing colleges for the limited student housing.

                My main goal boils down to getting Dutch citzenship and staying in the Netherlands. The details of how
                that will happen get a little unclear, however, but the main idea is known at this point. I want to get
                a job with a software development agency in the Netherlands, and stay for at least 5 years (the time
                required to get citzenship). I found Software Engineering to be the optimal engineering field for myself
                - I always knew that I wanted to be an engineer of some kind. Civil engineering was the first field I
                aimed for, but I found that it dealed too much with the designing of the pouring of concrete - a very
                dull task. Petroleum engineering had too many moral conflicts, while electrical engineering made me want
                to pull my hair out - I'll leave the hardware design to the hardware engineers. Chemical engineering was
                the second choice, but Software engineering applied more directly to all of my interests, and
                critically, would allow me to better live abroad. My hope is to exit this program fully prepeared to
                enter the Dutch workforce and start coding for a company.
