                In response to the assignment that has been thoroughly referenced on this blog, I recieved some feedback
                from one of my teachers. This is the feedback, and my response to that feedback.

                Hi Noah,

                Thank you for filling in the form. If you still like trains and maybe also enjoy a little history we
                have a great tourist sitting about a 15-minute drive from Middelburg. you might want to check it out.
                https://www.destoomtrein.nl/?lang=en although young as you are might find that totally boring, family
                that might come to visit will love it ;-) I am curious considering your motivation why specifically you
                chose ICT from the background story I would have thought you to choose a more basic engineering kind of
                track. Even though it does get you into the Netherlands, our study program will focus on software
                programming for the first two years. You do not need any IT experience that's true but it is a bit of a
                hardcore developers track, just keep that in mind. By the way, you do not need to be fluent in Dutch to
                have a job in the Netherlands. Most of us speak English or are internationally focused. You might be
                interested in following Dutch language courses. Tell us if you do at the start of the school year so we
                can inform you of the possibilities. ADHD might give you some challenges but doesn't have to. We have
                coaches who can always help you out and your appointed study coach can help too. Once started in our
                program our Dean will ask you to fill in a form so you can have approval for additional exam time by
                obtaining a facility card. You may need some medical proof from your doctor to apply for a facility
                card. If you want to know more specifics upfront you can contact brigitte.pommee@hz.nl she can answer
                all your questions in those regards. Based on your form I do not see a need for an individual
                conversation. You already found my email address so any questions you have just ask! we will be having a
                group information session in June and July on which you will be informed, so for now good luck on exams
                you might have and hope to meet you soon <br>Kind regards, <br>Daphne
            </p>

                Overall I was quite neutral to this feedback. On the one hand, she didn't immediately say I had no
                chance succeeding in this program (what a relief!), but she also made me slightly unconfident in my
                existing skills. The process with the ADHD sounded like too much of a hassle, so I decided I would just
                do my best and deal with the consequences if it came to it. At this point, I was assuming I was going to
                immediately get a job, but I've come to the conclusion as a result of how scary she makes the class seem
                that I should bide my time and see if I even have time to get a job, or if I will just have to make do
                with student loans and future Noah can deal with that later.
