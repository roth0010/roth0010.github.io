      <h1>WHO AM I Profile</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Noah Roth
        <ul>
          <li>19 Years Old</li>
          <li>Went to Molalla High School on the west coast of the US</li>
        </ul>
    Most of my coding experience comes from engineering, math and science classes taken at Molalla High School.</p>
    <h2>Extra-Curricular Activites</h2>
    <p>I was really hoping to continue my competitive running "career" in the Netherlands, but I haven't found a club team in the area that I could run for. I'm still doing a lot of running and biking though, in hopes that I somehow didn't search hard enough.</p>
    <p>I'm especially interested in City Planning, Planes, Boats, and Motorsport, but my biggest interest would be Trains.</p>
    <p>Specifically, I find Japanese and European trains the most interesting</p>

    <p>I also want to continue doing my hobbies, such as video production and sim racing, but these have mostly been put aside as I put time into learning Nederlands.</p>
    <p>Once I feel like I've gotten an understanding of the workload for this program, I'll evaluate whether I have time to get a job.</p>
