      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>My name is Noah Roth</p>
      <div>
        <ul class="details" type="circle">
          <li &bull>I'm 19 Years Old</li> <br>
          <li &bull>I went to Molalla High School on the west coast of the US</li> <br>
          <li &bull>I'm fairly introverted until I get talking about something I'm interested in</li><br>
          <li &bull>I'm very motivated to succeed in school for numerous reasons, such as the fact that I can't stay
            if I fail...</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p> Most of my limited coding experience comes from engineering, math and science classes taken at Molalla High
        School.
      </p>
      <h2>Extra-Curricular Activites</h2>
      <p>I was really hoping to continue my competitive running "career" in the Netherlands, but I haven't found a club
        team in the area that I could run for. I'm still doing a lot of running and biking though, in hopes that I
        somehow
        didn't search hard enough.</p>
      <p>I'm especially interested in City Planning, Planes, Boats, and Motorsport, but my biggest interest would be
        Trains. Specifically, I find Japanese and European trains the most interesting.</p>

      <p>My interest in city planning is how I came to like the Netherlands, and the fiets paden that connect the
        country are why I decided to move across the world.
        I like biking to begin with, and I really enjoy the Dutch style of biking. I was actually surprised how quickly
        I was comfortable riding without a helmet!
      </p>
      <p>I want to continue doing my hobbies, such as video production and sim racing, but these have mostly been
        put aside as I put time into learning Nederlands.</p>
      <p>Once I feel like I've gotten an understanding of the workload for this program, I'll evaluate whether I have
        time to get a job. At the moment though, I am enjoying life and making Youtube videos in my limited free time.
