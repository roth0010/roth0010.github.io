            <h4>What the teachers had to say about my website.</h4>
            <p>
                As I eluded to in the previous article, the response to the website was not a "Well done, you've nailed
                it, you don't have to touch the website again" that I was hoping it would be. Instead, it was a slap in
                the face of sorts that sent me back to the ground. I'm the type that rolls back to my feet in one fell
                swoop from such setbacks, letting critiscism and failure bounce off myself like a shell glancing the
                curved edges of a Battleship, failing to penetratet and flinging it's very being into the water without
                harm. Before I had even sat down from my presentation, I was already calculating what could be done to
                fix the criticisms launched at me. As a whole, the feedback was negative - between the two teachers that
                came to have a look at the website, only one had anything positive to say about the website - even that
                was just a passing remark about the quality of my feedback, a point set moot by the other teachers
                seeming inability to understand the sheer fury behind my blue eyes when I see the bike paths and
                railways of the Netherlands, dreaming of a life that could only be lived in Nederlands. That teacher
                seems to have it in their head that I'm going to lose heart and flop out of the program, ending up in
                one of the less interesting disciplines like civil engineering or mechanical engineering. I've made it
                clear in the past the reasons I cast these disciplines aside, but for those just catching up: Civil
                engineering deals with too much concrete pouring, while Mechanical engineering is too much theoretical
                math, checking clearences, and not enough practicing the raw theory of engineering - if you can fit a
                round peg in the round hole, you can be a mechanical engineer. The first of these criticisms was that
                the overall colour pallet of the website was boring. To be fair, to the untrained eye (pun), it would
                seem to be the case - I, of course, knew that the colorscheme was a direct reference to the E6
                Shinkansen, my favourite of the whole of Asia. Nonetheless, it did pose a significant difficulty, as it
                was basically a two-tone scheme: despite having a nice red and two shades of grey, the grey's ended up
                having the effect of making it a two-tone scheme since the only exciting colour was the red. The
                solution to this launched other ideas for improvement, but that's a different article entirely. One of
                the biggest criticisms, and one touched on previously, is the innerworkings of the website. Tags were a
                little disorganized, I was having trouble getting the Nav bar formatting to not take over other parts of
                the website, and as a whole the entire back end needed a little tidying up. I'll put that one down to
                inexperience. The last piece was merely that I had kind of missed the mark with the companies - we were
                supposed to research companies we were interested in joining, and while that was done a little bit, one
                of the companies was done merely to make fun of that particular consulting company, and the other two
                were more out of couriousity than pure desire. These were, of course, already setting off the planning
                parts of my head, formulating a plan to fix these issues.</p>
