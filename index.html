        <h4>I'm Noah Roth, here's my story</h4>
        <p id="journey">My journey to deciding what exactly to do in life was no straight line. I've always loved
            engineering in one
            form or another, but I could never decide on what exactly I wanted to do. From a young age, my deep
            interest in trains, planes, and race cars completely absorbed me, and drove my life goals. I was
            diagnosed with
            what was then known as Asperger syndrome, but is today considered a part of the Autism spectrum. The only
            major way this affected my life besides causing my constant obsessions over certain topics - trains et al -
            was through a lack of social skills. Whether I was actually an introvert or not, my condition ultimately
            made me one regardless. My mother would often take me to a coffee shop in a strip mall near my house; there
            was a mural of a typical european town within that coffee shop, where a very young Noah often said he wanted
            to live.
            At one point, I got to ride the local train, which ironically sparked a different passion in my soul:
            Shinkansen. Youtube was just reaching the realm of the common world at this time, and a young Noah managed
            to weave his way from train video to train video in advance of that special day, initially starting with
            American trains but meandering towards the far more
            interesting world of Japanese railways. They seemed almost unreal, these colorful trains shooting between
            tunnels in a mountainous land of self-discipline and respect.</p>

        <h6>An N700A Shinkansen passes in front of Mt Fuji (tansaisuketti).</h6>
        <p>The truth was that America wasn't very stimulating for a train loving kid, as trains are few and far between
            in the "land of the free." This was why I often dreamed of life in other countries on other continents, far
            away from my own. My father often told me how many people with my condition overcame their issues, and found
            success in the
            field of engineering. This was the main drive behind my interest in engineering. I initially wanted to dive
            into civil engineering, designing bridges and railway lines, but I was soon bored by the amount of time
            spent on designing the pouring of concrete. My desire to move away from America rose as I began
            to learn about the history of the country and the current state it was in. Driving was the only way to get
            around nearly every city - by design, not by accident - and downtowns were destroyed when freeways were
            forced through their neighborhoods. Trains were all but
            exctinct outside New York City, and even my neck of the woods - one of the more "European like" in the
            country, was not fortunate enough to recieve train service beyond a few trains per day. I started to set my
            sights on
            where in Europe I wanted to move, and what I wanted to do.</p>

        <p id="journey">Somewhere along the way, I started a new stage of my life: Martial Arts. I initially started
            because I
            thought it was cool, but I kept going because I fell in love with the art. Karate taught me the
            aformentioned values that are often reflected in Japan, which was quickly becoming a bit of a holy grail in
            my life.
            It wasn't until nearly 8 years later that I hung my gi and called it a career, not for a lack of interest
            but for a change of ownership in the dojo that resulted in a lose of the discipline and respect that I had
            felt when I joined the school years earlier. I also started to seriously look at my option for engineering
            at this time,
            seeing as civil engineering was no longer practical.</p>
        <ul class="details">
            <li class="std-list">Petroleum engineering was briefly considered because it was the best paying of the engineering
                disciplines, but I found myself objecting on moral grounds over personally contributing to climate
                change if I went into that field.</li><br>
            <li class="std-list">Electrical engineering was soon discarded, as my high school engineering classes taught me I couldn't
                keep up with a circuit beyond a simple design. Seriously, electrical engineers are made of something
                else.</li><br>
            <li class="std-list">Mechanical engineering was a definite option - in hindsight, this should've been explored more as this
                would've given me an in on working on race cars and trains, but the pay wasn't as great as other
                disciplines, and critically I found more interest in other things.</li><br>
            <li class="std-list">I found that I actually enjoyed some parts of chemical engineering, or at least the chemistry class my
                high school offered.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Software engineering soon
            emerged as the optimal solution to my problem; It paid well enough, it could be done remotely (Theoretically
            I could work and live anywhere with internet), it related to
            most of my interests
            in some form or another, and I had always been mildly interested in technology. I wasn't the type who was
            going out of my way to learn C# or anything like that, but my high school classes soon showed me that I
            could be up to the task. I feel this is the right choice for me career, and I really hope I'm not proved
            wrong in the coming weeks.

            no longer in service (Sir Pompously).</h6>
        <p id="journey">The story doesn't stop there though. I came from a small town about an hour drive from Portland,
            Oregon. I
            used to think this was the city I wanted to live in, as it had a decent sneltram system, was fairly
            welcoming to cycling (not like the Dutch, though), and had some lovely scenary. Unfortunately, the city's
            opinion on expanding it's country
            leading sneltram system had started to change, as they voted down an important extension of the system last
            year. This was ultimately the straw that broke the camels back, combined with the divisions in America over
            mundane issues, poor urban planning and lack of options for transportation. I decided I was done with
            America and going to do everything in my
            power to leave. I had decided nearly a year earlier that Nederland was the country I was going to aim to get
            myself to, but this choice wasn't a straight and clear choice. The Netherlands boasts an incredible train
            system that connects the entire country, incredible biking infrastructure, and good urban planning that
            creates good cities and a
            good country. It's only drawback was that I would have to learn a new language if I wanted to stay long term
            (I do), something that places like England and Ireland didn't have to contend with in my "competition of
            countries." England was ultimately too car dependent and didn't have interesting enough food - seriously,
            you invaded half the world
            in search of spices then decided you liked none of them - and Ireland, despite being beautiful and having a
            laid back culture, ultimately lost out because it didn't have the biking infrastructure of the Netherlands
            (Side note: I've realised I can walk to places far easier in Europe than I had initially guessed, so maybe
            dense cities like Dublin should've
            been given more credit). France lost because of the complexity of French, Denmark lost because Danish is
            unintelligable, and the Nordic countries lost because I doubt I could survive with that little sunlight in
            the winter.</p>

        <h6>An E3 Tsubasa Shinkansen on the Yamagata mini-Shinkansen (ACPRail).</h6>
        <p> The biggest suprise to me in this process was the land of the rising sun, Japan, which lost out
            early because of
            the countries opinion towards
            foreigners. Finding an apartment, making friends, everything is hard in Japan if you aren't Japanese, which
            ultimately meant I had to remove it from my options. It's still an incredible country that I definitely plan
            on visiting if and when I'm fluent in Japanese (I'm learning really, really slowly) and may even consider
            living in under the exact right conditions (Probably not going to happen). For now though, it's just a
            mountainous country with really cool trains. I didn't really have a plan of how to get myself to the
            Netherlands
            - it's difficult, nay impossible to get a job as a US citizen for a multitude of reasons. My best hope was
            to manage to hit the jackpot and create a Youtube channel that could support me, making myself self employed
            and having a far easier time moving to Nederland. Once again, in hindsight this was a foolish idea that was
            never going to work, but it did succeed in giving myself a new hobby.

        <p id="journey">
            I was mindlessly browsing the web one December evening when I got some urge to take another look at my
            options for getting myself to Nederland. I hadn't considered the option of going to university in Nederland
            - I didn't even know it was an option - but something tipped me off that night, and I soon started planning
            how I could apply to a Dutch college, be accepted to said college, book housing near said college, and get
            myself over to Nederland in around 8 and a half months. Initially I was looking at the higher tier of
            University, like in Nijmegen or Maastricht, but those required 4 AP tests. I had taken one of those at the
            time and was scheduled to take another one in the spring, but that would be only two tests.
            Additionally, some of the tests the universities wanted were for classes my school didn't even offer. I was
            clearly not going to make it to these bigger colleges, so I had to start looking elsewhere. I found the
            wikipedia page for HBO colleges in the Netherlands and checked the websites of every single college to see
            which even had my area of studies. These were then compared, ranked on things like location, likelyhood of
            getting housing, tuition, and I then prepared to apply. I initially applied for another college, Saxion in
            Deventer, but on a whim I also applied to HZ. This would be a saving grace. Saxion failed to reply to any of
            my emails to them, and their housing - that they required first years stay in - didn't get great reviews. HZ
            was cool to me because it was near the sea in a quiet corner of the country, and the school seemed
            responsive to my emails. I had my choice done, and my conditional acceptance came not long after. I finished
            High School in America, worked through the summer, then got on a plane and navigated my way across the world
            to Middelburg.
