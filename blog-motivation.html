            <h4>My Motivation for ICT</h4>
            <p>
                Extrinsic motivation is the act of being motivated by outside rewards or consequences, be that a larger
                paycheck or a gain in reputation. Intrinsic motivation comes from within, a desire to make one's self
                better or to get one's self to a better place. Good works can come from Extrinsic motivation, but the
                greatest works come from Intrinsic motivation. My motivation is rarely Extrinsic - about the only
                example I can think of is my need to do well in school and in my professional career to stay in the
                Netherlands - but rather it comes from a desire to make myself better, to put myself in a better place,
                and to show the world that I'm one of the best around. My motivation comes from a desire to have a
                career that suits me, to have a career that puts me in a position where I don't have to stress over
                financials, a career that is adjacent to my interests and can somehow relate to them all. ICT fits the
                bill, and gives me the option to work in a wide variety of places thanks to the high demand for the
                occupation. Being sorrounded by my motivation - bikes, trains, boats, the Netherlands - I don't think
                I'll have much issue staying motivated here in the Netherlands.

                ICT has many benifits that make it a good fit for me. The work is mostly done on a computer, which
                allows it to be a mobile profession. The job is in demand, which removes some of the concern about
                finding a job after college, and I found it to be the branch of engineering that fits my needs and wants
                the best - More detail on this is available in the "My Story" page. I feel that, as long as I am capable
                of keeping up with the classes, I can be very succsesful in this area. ICT has a nice balance between
                easy busywork where one is pounding out line after line of code, then getting stuck on an issue and
                spending three hours trying to diagnose the issue and fix it. The success right after getting the
                computer to do what you want it to do is one of the feelings that makes me want to continue.

                I've known for more than a little while that I wanted to go into the field of engineering - again, more
                on the "My Story" page - and as such I was able to do some projects within the field of engineering and
                coding. Unfortunately, many have been lost to time, as my old high school shut down my email account
                preventing me from signing into many of the websites that would otherwise have my old projects. Projects
                of note recently include coding a small robot to follow a line like a race car, coding the same robot to
                roam around the room like a roomba, and creating a website that started as a way to tell you which
                national park you were closest to (provided you were in a national park), but it quickly devolved into a
                meme machine with many traps and rick rolls as the mischievous side of me took over. One of the few
                times coding kind of became my hobby was when I was dealing with technical difficulties with one of my
                racing simulators. The game is based on an older engine and had a poor UI, so I had to dig around the
                game files in .json files edited on notepad to find some of the issues and fix them. I figured some
                settings and hidden features of the simulator out on my own, which was rewarding. I've also done a lot
                of coding academy-type things in class before, but nothing too hardcore. This website is easily the most
                complex thing I've coded to date, but I hope that record doesn't stand for long.
